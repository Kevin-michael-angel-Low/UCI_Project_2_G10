      <h3 align=center>CALIFORNIA AND FLORIDA COVID RESTRICTIONS TIMELINE</h3>
      <p>Below is a timeline of COVID restrictions made by state governers to maintain the pandemic. To understand the information better, we can compare closures and openings of certain facilities to determine if hospital capacities are related to it.</p>
      <h6><b>California</b></h6>
      <p>Even though California was closed for most of the year, implementing numerous closures and mandates, the hospital capacities kept rising.</p>
      <p>California began outdoor reopenings in October, but shut down once again in November, initiating a statewide curfew. </p>
      <h6><b>Florida</b></h6>
      <p>Florida began closing borders and shutting down facilities about the same time as California, but Florida started reopening September 2020.</p>
      <p>Facilities such as movie theaters, indoor entertainment, and bars were allowed to reopen with reduced capacities. Schools reopened in October. </p>
